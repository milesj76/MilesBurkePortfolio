# MilesBurkePortfolio

This is my portfolio! Handmade. My first concern is to finish it so that I have a place to house links to my other projects. Second, I need to complete it in order to start applying for jobs. Last, this project will be improved upon in later versions once I've got an improved understanding of web development and design.

The goal is to get my first job as a developer so that I can get experience and hopefully make connections with better programmers. After working many different jobs, it's very clear to me that people are happy to share what they know when someone shows a real interest. Being able to learn new and interesting things while getting paid has been one of my favorite things about working a job. I hope I can convey such interest by working diligently on my projects.

It's been encouraging to see my interest in programming grow as I've worked past the initial learning curve. It's become much, much more interesting as I continue to dive into it. I'm really hoping I can land a good job, starting on this new career path that I'm really excited to work in. Who knows what I'll be capable of after several years of work? :)

If you are seeing this project, feel free to send me any tips on what I could do to make my site better! I appreciate any and all information.
