I want to work with you to build something. So let's get to work.</p></div>

                    I'm a self-taught programmer who's most familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm familiar with libraries/frameworks like Bootstrap and React, languages like Python, although my focus lately has been to use Vanilla JS in order to get a deeper understanding of it. I'm also very interested in software development and back end development.
